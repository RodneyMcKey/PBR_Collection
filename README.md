# PBR_Collection
Beware that A SHIT TON of things are not made.
If you want to ask for textures to be made, create an issue. I'll prioritize these textures.

Installation:
Dowload repo as zip. Pick the suitable archive inside of it for you. Folders are for anyone willing to look ai it from git. If you are not using any texture packs just pick GTNH_PBR.
Note that PBR resource packs doesn't contain all original textures, only modified ones. You still need resouce pack. <br>
